Many of the files here are simply copies of a Perl distribution.  

There are here to use with mrskew.

Some are custom, such as ForceMatch.pm and its supporting files.
 
The SQLNormalizer.pm package can be used to generate force matching IDs for SQL statements.

These will not match what Oracle generates, but that does not matter for offline SQL analysis.
